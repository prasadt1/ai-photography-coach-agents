    "coach_response": "Great question! Let's refine the composition here. I notice your main subject is currently right in the center of the frame, which can sometimes make a photo feel a little static.\n\nTo create more visual interest, try applying the Rule of Thirds. Imagine a tic-tac-toe grid over your photo and position your main subject along one of those lines, or even better, at one of the four intersection points. This simple shift often makes an image feel more balanced and dynamic, guiding the viewer's eye through the scene.",

    "coach_response": "Let's revisit those beautiful sunset settings! For a rich, vibrant shot, start with an ISO between 100-400 to minimize noise, an aperture of f/8 to f/16 for good depth of field, and adjust your shutter speed until the exposure looks right \u2013 you might even try a \"Cloudy\" white balance to enhance those warm tones.\n\nI noticed your previous photo had the subject quite centered; for an even more dynamic sunset, try applying the Rule of Thirds. This means placing your horizon or the sun slightly off-center, perhaps along one of the grid lines, rather than right in the middle. Also, keep an eye out for leading lines in your scene, like a path or fence, to draw the viewer's eye towards the sunset for added impact.",

Great question, let's dive into the rule of thirds again, it's a fundamental one!\n\nThe rule of thirds is a compositional guideline that suggests imagining a 3x3 grid over your image (like a tic-tac-toe board). Instead of centering your subject, as was detected in your current photo, you aim to place your key elements along these lines or at their intersections. This simple technique creates more dynamic and visually interesting compositions than a centered shot. Try turning on the grid overlay on your camera or phone and experimenting with placing your subject off-center for an immediate impact!",
