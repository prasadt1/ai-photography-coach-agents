    "coach_response": "Great question, and thanks for coming back for more composition tips! I'm noticing again that your main subject is quite centered in this shot, which can sometimes make a photo feel a little static.\n\nTo really elevate your composition, let's focus on the **Rule of Thirds**. Instead of placing your subject dead center, try imagining a 3x3 grid over your frame and positioning your key subject or points of interest along those grid lines or at their intersections. This technique often creates a more dynamic and engaging image that naturally draws the viewer's eye through the scene. Experiment with moving your subject slightly to one of these \"sweet spots\" and see the difference!",

    "prompt": "What camera settings should I use for a sunset shot?",
    "coach_response": "Hey there! For a beautiful sunset shot, you'll want to start with a low ISO, around 100-200, to keep your image clean. Try an aperture like f/8 to f/16 for a good depth of field and crisp details, letting your camera's meter guide your shutter speed \u2013 often a faster shutter to avoid overexposing the bright sky. While setting up, remember to avoid placing the sun or any main subject dead center; instead, apply the Rule of Thirds by positioning key elements near the grid intersections, or use leading lines to guide the viewer's eye for a more dynamic and engaging composition.",

The advice on shutter speed, while aiming to avoid overexposure, is simplified and doesn't fully address the complexities of managing dynamic range in sunset photography without further context on metering modes or compensation, which impacts its accuracy score slightly.",
