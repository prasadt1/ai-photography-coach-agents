    "coach_response": "Great question about composition! To truly elevate your image, let's focus on simplifying and refining.\n\nI've noticed a `weak_focal_point` and `cluttered_background`, making it hard for your main subject to stand out. Try getting closer to your subject or adjusting your angle to isolate it more effectively, perhaps by using a wider aperture to blur distractions. Also, addressing the `horizon_tilt` by ensuring a level horizon will instantly make the photo feel more stable and professional, and remember to consider the `rule of thirds` for stronger subject placement.\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Supporting Resources** (Curated Photography Books):\n\n\u2022 Centered subjects: Beginners tend to center everything.

    "vision_summary": "This image presents a charming scene featuring a bicycle adorned with sunflowers beside a traditional half-timbered building on a paved street.

    "coach_response": "Hey there! Great to revisit those sunset settings, especially with your recent photos in mind. For a striking sunset, aim for a low ISO (100-400) and an aperture of f/8 to f/11 to ensure sharpness from front to back, letting your shutter speed adjust to achieve a balanced exposure that really brings out those vibrant colors\u2014you might even try underexposing slightly for a richer sky.\n\nAs you dial those in, also focus on your composition: actively look for a strong focal point and use the Rule of Thirds to place it, which will help eliminate `weak focal points`, `dead space`, and `cluttered backgrounds`. And remember, keeping your `horizon level` will instantly elevate the shot, making sure your `subject is framed beautifully` and not cut off.\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Supporting Resources** (Curated Photography Books):\n\n\u2022 Centered subjects: Beginners tend to center everything.
